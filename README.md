# Weighted K-Means++ Clustering

This repository contains Python implementations of the weighted K-Means++ clustering algorithm. The weighted K-Means++ algorithm is an extension of the classical K-Means clustering algorithm that accounts for sample weights during centroid initialization. The provided implementations include both the main algorithm and the computational components for initializing cluster centroids.

## Usage

To use the weighted K-Means++ clustering algorithm in your Python project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vaibhavchvn14/weighted-kmeansplusplus.git
   ```

2. Copy the necessary Python files (`skeleton.py`, `Uniform_Sampling.py`, `wkpp.py`) into your project directory.

3. Import the `kmeans_plusplus_w` function from `wkpp.py` into your Python script:

   ```python
   from wkpp import kmeans_plusplus_w
   ```

4. Call the `kmeans_plusplus_w` function with your data and desired number of clusters:

   ```python
   centers, indices = kmeans_plusplus_w(X, n_clusters)
   ```

5. Use the returned `centers` array to initialize the cluster centroids for K-Means clustering.
